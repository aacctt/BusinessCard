# Image scanner
A react-native app that uses [react-native-text-detector](https://github.com/zsajjad/react-native-text-detector), i.e. [Firebase ML-Kit](https://firebase.google.com/products/ml-kit/) for recognizing text from a picture taken with the phone. Supports Android and iOS (not tested).
This is a fork of [zsajjad/BusinessCard](https://github.com/zsajjad/BusinessCard).
